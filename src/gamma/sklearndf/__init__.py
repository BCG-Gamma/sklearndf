`sklearndf` augments more than 150 scikit-learn estimators for native support of data
frames, while leaving the original API intact.

Augmented scikit-learn classes are named after their native scikit-learn counterparts,
with `DF` added as a suffix:
:class:`.SimpleImputer` becomes :class:`.SimpleImputerDF`,
:class:`RandomForestRegressor` becomes :class:`RandomForestRegressorDF`,
and so on.

For all methods expecting an `X` argument for a feature matrix and potentially a
`y` argument for one or more targets, `sklearndf` estimators expect a pandas
:class:`.DataFrame` for `X` and a pandas :class:`.Series` for a 1-dimensional `y`,
or a pandas :class:`DataFrame` when fitting to multiple targets or outputs.
This includes methods such as :meth:`~BaseEstimatorDF.fit`,
:meth:`~TransformerDF.transform`, :meth:`~LearnerDF.predict`, and so on.

All estimators enhanced by `sklearndf` also implement an additional attribute
:attr:`~BaseEstimatorDF.features_in`, keeping track of the column names of the data
frame used to fit the estimator.

`sklearndf` transformers also implement :attr:`~TransformerDF.features_out` and
:attr:`~TransformerDF.features_original`, keeping track of the feature names of the
transformed outputs as well as mapping output features back to the input features.
Tnis  enables tracing features back to the original inputs even across complex
pipelines (see allso :class:`.PipelineDF`)

`sklearndf` classes implement a class hierarchy that follows the taxonomy of
scikit-learn classes (but is only partially reflected via class inheritance in the
original implementation):

- all `sklearndf` transformers are subclasses of :class:`.TransformerDF`, which \
  in turn provides the API for all common transformer methods, e.g., \
  :meth:`~TransformerDF.transform`
- all `sklearndf` regressors are subclasses of :class:`.RegressorDF`, which \
  in turn provides the API for all common regressor methods, e.g., \
  :meth:`~RegressorDF.predict`
- all `sklearndf` classifiers are subclasses of :class:`.ClassifierDF`, which \
  in turn provides the API for all common classifier methods, e.g., \
  :meth:`~ClassifierDF.predict_proba`
- all `sklearndf` regressors and classifiers are subclasses of :class:`.LearnerDF`
- all `sklearndf` estimators are subclasses of :class:`.BaseEstimatorDF`

`sklearndf` introduces two additional pipeline classes, :class:`.RegressorPipelineDF` and
:class:`.ClassifierPipelineDF`, with an abstract base class :class:`.LearnerPipelineDF`,
to allow for easier handling of common types of ML pipelines.
These classes implement pipelines with two steps -- one preprocessing step, followed by
a regressor or a classifier.

`sklearndf` also provides data frame support for a selection of custom or 3rd-party
estimators, most notably :class:`.BorutaDF`, :class:`.LGBMRegressorDF`, and
:class:`.LGBMClassifierDF`.

All `sklearndf` estimators are fully type hinted.
